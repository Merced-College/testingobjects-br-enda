# testingObjects

this is an example of a ReadMe file.

1. Cat@6d06d69c printed out. It printed this out because java doesnt know how to convert an object into a string unless you tell it. So it shows the memory location instead.
2. String name defaults to null, int age defaults to 0, and String bread deafaults to null.
3. The default constructor gave my object starter values. The parameterized constructor let me make custom cats with my own values.
4. It tells Java im overiding a method, helping it catch any mistakes.
5. It protects the date from bad values. In setAge() I could make sure age cant be negative.
